* 2. Simple Regression - Model 1
*-----------------------------------------------------------

* Simple regression with Amount and Age
regress Amount Age

* Interpretation: Each additional year reduces the fine amount by an average of $131 USD. 
* This effect is statistically significant at the 1% and 5% levels (p-value < 0.01 and < 0.05).
sum Amount Age

* RÂ² = 0.0043: The driver's age explains 0.43% of the fine amount, while the rest is explained by other factors not included in the regression.

*-----------------------------------------------------------
* 3. Multiple Regression - Model 2
*-----------------------------------------------------------

* Multiple regression with Amount, Age, and MPHover
regress Amount Age MPHover

* Correlation between Age and MPHover
pwcorr Age MPHover, sig

* Interpretation: With the inclusion of the MPHover variable, the coefficient of the Age variable increases from -0.29 to 0.028.
* This is because the first regression did not account for the speed over the limit, which is an important factor in determining the fine amount.

*-----------------------------------------------------------
* 4. Model 3 - Regression with Additional Variables
*-----------------------------------------------------------

* Multiple regression with Age, MPHover, and other binary variables
regress Amount Age MPHover Female Black Hispanic OutState

* Interpretation of results:
* - Age: The effect is not statistically significant.
* - MPHover: Each additional mile per hour over the speed limit increases the fine amount by an average of $7 USD. Statistically significant.
* - Female: The fine amount decreases by $3 USD on average for female drivers. Statistically significant.
* - Black: The effect is not statistically significant.
* - Hispanic: The fine amount increases by $2.86 USD on average for Hispanic or Latino drivers. Statistically significant.
* - OutState: The fine amount increases by $9.79 USD on average for drivers residing in another state. Statistically significant.

*-----------------------------------------------------------
* 5. Heterogeneity Analysis (MPHover squared)
*-----------------------------------------------------------

* Generate the variable ln(Amount) and perform regression
gen lnAmount = ln(Amount)
regress lnAmount Age MPHover

* Generate the variable MPHover squared and perform regression
generate MPHover_squared = MPHover^2
regress lnAmount Age MPHover MPHover_squared

* Calculate the effect of an additional mile per hour:
di (_b[MPHover] + 2*_b[MPHover_squared]*0)*100   * Effect of 1 mile: increase by 8.28%

* Calculate the effect of 20 miles:
di (_b[MPHover] + 2*_b[MPHover_squared]*20)*100  * Effect of 20 miles: increase by 4.9%

* Calculate the effect of 50 miles:
di (_b[MPHover] + 2*_b[MPHover_squared]*50)*100  * Effect of 50 miles: decrease by -0.16%

* Calculate the effect of 100 miles:
di (_b[MPHover] + 2*_b[MPHover_squared]*100)*100  * Effect of 100 miles: decrease by -8.61%

* Interpretation: The effect of speed over the limit is negative but increasing, as the coefficient of MPHover is positive and the coefficient of MPHover_squared is negative.
